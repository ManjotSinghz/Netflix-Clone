Hey fellow developers 👥 and tech enthusiasts!
I'm thrilled to share with you my latest project - a Netflix webpage clone built using only HTML and CSS! It's been a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

It took me over a week to complete this project, and I must say, it was a steep learning curve. I relied heavily on 📺 YouTube tutorials and 💻 online resources to guide me through the process. The journey was not easy, but it was worth it. I learned new techniques, improved my coding skills, and developed a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.

Although it's not a perfect replica 😁 , I'm proud of what I've achieved. The clone features a responsive design, working navigation menu, and a similar layout to the original Netflix webpage.

I'm excited to take on more challenging projects and continue learning new skills. I'm considering to add javascript to this clone in future. Let's see how it works.

I hope my project inspires you to take on new challenges and push your limits. Remember, learning is a continuous process, and there's always room for improvement.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback and comments!
